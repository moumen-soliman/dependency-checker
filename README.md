# Dependency Checker CLI

**Dependency Checker CLI** is a powerful command-line tool that analyzes the dependencies in your `package.json` file. It checks for the latest versions available on npm, determines upgrade requirements, and provides insights into your projectâ€™s dependencies.

![Demo](./demo.gif)

## Features

- Analyze dependencies from `package.json` (including nested dependencies in `overrides`).
- Check for updates and classify them as major, minor, or patch.
- Identify whether a dependency will self-upgrade based on semantic versioning rules.
- Supports complex version ranges like `>=1.0.0 <3.0.0`.
- Provides a clear and concise output for easy readability.
- Compatible with `package-lock.json` and `yarn.lock`.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g dependency-checker-cli
